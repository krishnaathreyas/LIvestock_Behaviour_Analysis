🐄 Multi-Modal Livestock Health and Behavior Analysis
🚜 Empowering smart dairy farming with AI-driven early disease detection.

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on improving the health monitoring of dairy cattle using a multi-modal machine learning system. Traditional manual observation by farmers is often inefficient and error-prone. Our solution enables early detection of illnesses in cows using wearable sensor data, stationary observations, and farmer-reported symptoms — all wrapped into an easy-to-use web application.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Detect early signs of sickness in dairy cows

✅ Assist farmers with a simple digital interface

✅ Improve animal welfare and dairy productivity

✅ Reduce dependence on manual health checks

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Flask – Web backend

HTML, CSS – Frontend interface

MMCOWS Dataset – Real-world cattle behavior and health data

🧪 ML Model
We use a supervised machine learning model trained on multi-modal features such as:

Cow activity patterns

Symptoms reported by farmers (binary Yes/No)

Optional temperature readings (in °C)

Labels: Healthy or Needs Attention

The final model predicts the health condition of the cow with strong accuracy and minimal input.

🌐 Web Application (Flask-Based)
📋 Farmers answer a few yes/no questions (e.g., “Is the cow eating normally?”)

🌡️ Optionally enter cow’s body temperature

🧠 Model processes the data

✅ Result: Healthy or Sick – Needs Attention

📊 Evaluation
Accuracy: ~91% on validation data

Fast inference and lightweight deployment

Can run on low-end systems used in rural areas


🔒 Privacy & Offline Support
No cloud needed! The app can run completely offline, making it farmer-friendly in low-connectivity areas. Farmer data is not stored, ensuring privacy and trust.

🥛 Why This Matters
🐄 Cows account for over 80% of global milk production, making their health directly tied to food supply and farmer income. Early disease detection leads to:

Less milk loss

Lower treatment costs

Higher overall yield

🚀 Future Scope
Integration with real-time IoT sensors

Support for multiple animals and data logs

Multilingual UI (Kannada, Hindi, English)

Mobile app version for Android phones
